### Hi there 👋, Eni here

I’m passionate about **data** and the **software tools** that make it powerful. I love building, tinkering, and collaborating on projects that push the boundaries of data engineering, reliability, and automation.  

- 🔭 **Current focus:** Exploring cutting-edge open-source data tools and creating educational content around them.  
- 📚 **Always learning:** I dive into books, videos, and hands-on projects to sharpen my skills.  

Currently, I am experimenting with and contributing to projects at **[@uncoverthestack](https://github.com/uncoverthestack)**, including:  
- [**DQX**](https://github.com/databrickslabs/dqx) – Data quality with Databricks  
- [**Daft**](https://github.com/Eventual-Inc/Daft) – A high-performance Python DataFrame library  
- [**Airbyte**](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte) – Open-source data integration  
- [**SQLMesh**](https://github.com/TobikoData/sqlmesh) – Modern data transformation and workflow management  

💡 I occasionally explore **ML** and **AI**, especially when they intersect with large-scale data systems.
