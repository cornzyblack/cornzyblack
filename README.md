### Hi there 👋, Eni here  

I’m passionate about **data** and the **software tools** that make it powerful. I enjoy building, tinkering, and collaborating on projects that push the boundaries of data engineering, reliability, and automation.  

- 🔭 **Current focus:** Data quality frameworks, transformation workflows, and high-performance DataFrames.  
- 📚 **Always learning:** I grow my skills through books, experiments, and open-source contributions.  

**Open-source involvement:**  
- [**DQX**](https://github.com/databrickslabs/dqx) – Contributing to improving data quality tooling in Databricks.  
- Currently, I am learning Rust & JS [React] for some ideas, and I am exploring projects like [**Daft**](https://github.com/Eventual-Inc/Daft), and [**SQLMesh**](https://github.com/TobikoData/sqlmesh).

💡 I occasionally explore **ML** and **AI**, especially where they intersect with large-scale data systems.
